              With the evolution of artificial intelligence and an increase in conversation around mental health, AI therapists are becoming more common. While it seems strange to give a piece of technology an emotionally oriented task, a 2014 study conducted by the Institute for Creative Technologies revealed that some people find it easier to confide in AI than with a real person because they can express their emotions without feeling “judged.” While AI can make mental health help more accessible, convenient, and affordable, it does pose other problems. One issue is that therapy bots fuel the concept of “emotional capitalism” which is the over-rationalization of emotions that diminishes our feelings and relationships into products or commodities that can and should be logically managed.

            <h4>AI in Nursing Homes</h4>

              In China, they have been testing the implementation of robots in nursing homes as companions for the elderly that reside there. These robots seek to connect to the elderly who have transitioned from living with extended family to living alone. The robots might still be flawed and difficult to use, but the glitches or mistakes made often make the residents laugh. When asked the nursing home residents have mixed feelings about having these robots in their rooms, some believe they are not as good and cannot replace human beings but others say it makes them feel less lonely when they talk to them.

            <h4>My Thoughts</h4>

            <p>
              I think there is a danger with the culture AI therapy can create. With “emotion capitalism” comes this belief that you have to be able to “fix” your mental health issues rationally otherwise there is something wrong with you. Also, even though talking to one of these therapy bots on your computer and phone might be very quick and convenient, it can eventually emphasize the usage of devices that might contribute to mental health issues in the first place while divesting our attention to real human interaction. With nursing homes, I think that there are benefits to having something as a companion that is always easily available but it is not the same as a real person. While I find it weird to talk to chatbots as if they were a real therapist or companion, if used properly and in moderation, I think that they could be helpful for people who do find it beneficial not as a human replacement necessarily, but as a supplement.
