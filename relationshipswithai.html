              There are a lot of films and TV shows that feature AI as assistants, villains, or even significant others. The film <i>Her</i>, is about a man named Theodore who begins to date his operating system’s AI, Samantha, in the midst of his divorce. The <i>Black Mirror</i> episode, “Be Right Back” explores a similar concept with Martha who purchases an android replica of her boyfriend Ash, who was killed in a car crash. Both of these explore the complications of relationships with AI and focus on people experiencing tumultuous emotions surrounding some kind of loss who seek consolation in AI chatbots. With current technology, we aren’t too far away from these kinds of things becoming a real possibility, and these stories warn us about issues with developing relationships with AI, but also show us what people can gain and learn from relationships with AI.

            <h4>Project December & The Jessica Simulation</h4>

              Project December is an instance of AI developed by Jason Rohrer that allows users to create custom chatbots using sample utterances and a description, but the chatbot has a life span and will eventually “die” when it runs out of battery. A man named Joshua Barbeau decided to use Project December to make a chatbot replica of his deceased girlfriend, Jessica using her past text messages. It eventually became a form of therapy for his grief and provided some needed closure after because he was able to freely discuss his feelings and say things to her he never got to say.

            <p>
              To me, creating a replica of a deceased loved one would be extremely strange, but it seems to have helped other people like Joshua Barbeau in times of grief. So in that sense, I would not condemn this entirely because everyone processes emotions differently. However, I think there are possible issues with heavy reliance on AI chatbots as if they were a real person. There are always questions about what happens when the AI is not accessible anymore or is experiencing technical issues. Like most things, I think it could be healthy in moderation with the clear idea that the AI is a device to help you and not an actual person.
